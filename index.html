<a href=/tags/observability>observability</a><div><p>In the era of &ldquo;always on&rdquo; services and cloud platform, observability practises have become a central enabler to achieve this. But what is observablity? For starter, observability is not something strictly related to Software: in fact the concept of observability can be defined in much broader terms.</p><blockquote><p>Observability is a <strong>property</strong> of a system. A system is said to be observable if the internal state of the system can be inferred by the output signals generated by the system.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/observability/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/slo/>SLO practice with SpringBoot and Prometheus</a></h1><b><time>01.09.2024</time></b>
<a href=/tags/observability>observability</a><div><p>This article explains Service Level Objectives (SLOs), a monitoring practice aimed at ensuring systems provide an acceptable level of service. As with any practice, it won&rsquo;t make systems reliable on its own; developers need to follow it consistently for it to be fruitful. It requires discipline and time to become familiar with it, but it&rsquo;s a rewarding journey that you can add to your CV. If you&rsquo;re passionate about the topic, feel free to read the complete <a href=https://sre.google/books/>Google SRE books</a>; if not, we&rsquo;ll link specific chapters in the following paragraphs that will give you a good grasp of the subject.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/slo/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/alerting-as-testing/>The parallelism between testing and monitoring strategies</a></h1><b><time>19.08.2024</time></b>
<a href=/tags/observability>observability</a><div><p>At the beginning of my career, I was tasked with testing a ticket developed by a very senior developer on my team. When I opened the test instructions, to my surprise, I found this:</p><blockquote><p>Just deploy the changes to the staging environment. If something is not working, we&rsquo;ll get alerted.</p></blockquote><p>It was only a few years later when I really understood the wisdom behind this sentence, and this article will try to explain why alerting should be tought as a superset of testing.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/alerting-as-testing/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/>A day in Kubernetes</a></h1><b><time>11.12.2022</time></b>

<a href=/tags/hackday>hackday</a><div><p>Recentely I was asked if I had any experience in Kubernetes: well, long story short, I don&rsquo;t :)</p><p>But it poked my interest a bit, so I decided to give it a try and see what I can learn about it in a short time. It&rsquo;s a rainy Sunday, so it seems like a perfect day to concentrate and take a deep dive on the topic. Ideally I&rsquo;d want to be able to deploy a couple of services in Kubernetes and have them communicate with each other.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/>Why does this webiste exist?</a></h1><b><time>28.08.2022</time></b>

<a href=/tags/introduction>introduction</a><div><p>Hello there, welcome! You migth be wondering why does this corner of the web exist: let me try to answer the question.<br>I had the idea of creating a personal page in the back of my mind for a long time, mostly because I wanted to establish a stronger online presence than my empty LinkedIn profile. I wanted something that could represent me better than a CV, but that also would require little maintenance on my side.<br>On another note, I feel like I learn a lot of interesting things in my daily endevours and I would like to formalise these learnings in a written form to serve 2 main purposes:</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/about/>About</a></h1><b><time>20.08.2022</time></b><div><h1 id=about-myself>About myself</h1><p>Hello, it&rsquo;s a me Stefano!
