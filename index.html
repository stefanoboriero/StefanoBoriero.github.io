<a href=/tags/observability>observability</a><div><h1 id=service-level-objectives---slo>Service Level Objectives - SLO</h1><p>This document explains Service Level Objectives (SLOs), a monitoring practice aimed at ensuring systems provide an acceptable level of service. As with any practice, it won&rsquo;t make systems reliable on its own; developers need to follow it consistently for it to be fruitful. It requires discipline and time to become familiar with it, but it&rsquo;s a rewarding journey that you can add to your CV. If you&rsquo;re passionate about the topic, feel free to read the complete <a href=https://sre.google/books/>Google SRE books</a>; if not, we&rsquo;ll link specific chapters in the following paragraphs that will give you a good grasp of the subject.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/slo/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/>A day in Kubernetes</a></h1><b><time>11.12.2022</time></b>

It&rsquo;s a rainy Sunday, so it seems like a perfect day to concentrate and take a deep dive on the topic. Ideally I&rsquo;d want to be able to deploy a couple of services in Kubernetes and have them communicate with each other.</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/>Why does this webiste exist?</a></h1><b><time>28.08.2022</time></b>

<a href=/tags/introduction>introduction</a><div><p>Hello there, welcome! You migth be wondering why does this corner of the web exist: let me try to answer the question.<br>I had the idea of creating a personal page in the back of my mind for a long time, mostly because I wanted to establish a stronger online presence than my empty LinkedIn profile. I wanted something that could represent me better than a CV, but that also would require little maintenance on my side.<br>On another note, I feel like I learn a lot of interesting things in my daily endevours and I would like to formalise these learnings in a written form to serve 2 main purposes:</p><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/about/>About</a></h1><b><time>20.08.2022</time></b><div><h1 id=about-myself>About myself</h1><p>Hello, it&rsquo;s a me Stefano!
