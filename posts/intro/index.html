<a href=/tags/introduction>introduction</a><div><p>Hello there, welcome! You migth be wondering why does this corner of the web exist: let me try to answer the question.<br>I had the idea of creating a personal page in the back of my mind for a long time, mostly because I wanted to establish a stronger online presence than my empty LinkedIn profile. I wanted something that could represent me better than a CV, but that also would require little maintenance on my side.<br>On another note, I feel like I learn a lot of interesting things in my daily endevours and I would like to formalise these learnings in a written form to serve 2 main purposes:</p><ul><li>Clarify the mess in my head: the best way to know if you understood something, is to explain it to someone else, even if imaginary</li><li>Share my learnings with the community: my opinions might be not very useful on their own, but ideas often are born by connecting the dots in your head. I hope the content you&rsquo;ll find here will prove useful and sparkle something bigger</li></ul><p>So I finally decided to take the leap and start! I&rsquo;m still not clear about the final destination of this project, but sometimes you have to <em>just do it</em>.</p><h1 id=what-will-be-the-content-of-this-website>What will be the content of this website?</h1><p>Literally anything, I don&rsquo;t want to be constrained to any topic. It will mostly be about personal projects and learnings that I find useful. Or maybe some cooking recipes, who knows.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/slo/>SLO practice with SpringBoot and Prometheus</a></li><li><a href=/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/>A day in Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=/posts/intro/>Why does this webiste exist?</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://stefanoboriero.github.io/><b>Stefano</b></a>.
